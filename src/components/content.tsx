      <TH3>A Love Story</TH3>

      <TP>Annelot asked Tom to make her a playlist. Tom indulged her. She listened to it. And then she listened to it again. And then she listened to it again. And then she listened to it again.</TP>
      <TP>And then Annelot made Tom a playlist. And then he made her a second one. And then she made him another one. And then at some point, they just spent their days walking around on different continents, listening to music together, practically useless to everyone around them.</TP>
      <TP>A friend had asked Annelot if she was drunk when they spoke on the phone. She giggled too much. Oh wait, the friend said, I know why you sound so unhinged. You sound like someone falling in love. Tom laughed when Annelot told him about it. What does it mean to fall in love with someone you’ve never met? He sent her a song that they would later dance to at their wedding in Berlin.</TP>
      <TP>He booked a flight to Boston for the first weekend of March. They had made a shared playlist for the occasion. He was there for forty-six hours, which was just enough time to have breakfast in the diner down the street, to hold hands while walking around a small lake, to try some clam chowder at Legal Sea Foods and to finish listening to the 246 songs on their shared playlist together.</TP>
      <TP>When the pandemic forced her to return to the continent, he picked her up from the airport and took her home. They were locked down together, their respective flats a convenient fifteen minute walk apart that nobody ever took away from them. With nothing to do in a world closed up, they made a thousand playlists and shared a million songs. They played a billion games of cards. They made sure no birthday or Christmas was spent alone, cherishing each other to make up for everyone they missed.</TP>
      <TP>By the time people stopped wearing facemasks, they asked their parents to come to Copenhagen. In the King’s Garden, a man named Peter asked Tom if he wanted to marry Annelot, and Tom made sure to look into Annelot’s eyes and squeeze her hand as he calmly said to Peter that yes, he would like that very much. Annelot would interrupt Peter while he was halfway through asking her if she would like to marry Tom, saying that yes! yes! yes, she wanted that very much so.</TP>
      <TP>But love is best cultivated by sharing it with others, sanguinely multiplied by the act of being perceived, and so they planned a party for all of their loved ones who would never meet Peter. It would be a celebration of the weekend four years earlier, in the first weekend of March, when Tom stepped on a flight that would change the course of both of their lives.</TP>

      <TH3>A Wedding</TH3>

      <TP>The wedding will take place at Hallesches Haus (Tempelhofer Ufer 1, 10961 Berlin). The venue is located next to the U-Bahn and bus stop “Hallesches Tor”. If you enter the address in Google Maps, their public transportation option will tell you exactly how to get there. Alternatively, Hallesches Haus can also be reached by foot, bike or taxi. Public transport runs throughout the night.</TP>
      <TP>The dress code for the day is “please upstage the bride”. The wearing of wedding dresses is greatly encouraged. Annelot will not be wearing a white dress because she deems them too impractical, but she would truly enjoy it if other people would. Dramatic, extravagant, colorful, glittering or otherwise loud outfits are of course also applauded. High heels are discouraged because they hurt your feet.</TP>
      <TP>Guests are welcome at Hallesches Haus from 16:00 onwards. We fear that the day will be extremely boring for most humans under 18, but exhilarating for anyone 18 and up.</TP>
      <TP>The commitment ceremony, including the ring ceremony, will start around 16:30 and is led by our dear friend Chandrika Narayanan-Mohan.</TP>
      <TP>The rite will be followed by a sit-down family style dinner with copious room for speeches in English or Dutch. Translations will be provided to make sure all guests can enjoy the day to the fullest.</TP>
      <TP>Around 22:00, the couple hopes to be doing some awkward slow dancing in front of you to start off the wedding disco. The people at Hallesches Haus have begged us to get out at 03:00, but feel free to go clubbing in one of Berlin’s many all-weekender club options if you don’t want to go to bed yet. Let us know if you got into Berghain.</TP>
