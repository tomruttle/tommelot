        "text": "<TP>On the first day of February, 2020, Tom made Annelot a playlist. A day later, Annelot made Tom a playlist in return. When he finished listening to it, Tom made her a new playlist. This escalated until they were spending their days walking around on different continents listening to music together. They became practically useless to everyone around them.</TP><TP>On the last day of February, 2020, Tom stepped on a plane to Boston to meet Annelot. They had made a shared playlist for the occasion. Tom spent forty-six hours with her. It was just enough time to have breakfast in the diner down the street, to hold hands while walking around a small lake, to try some clam chowder and to finish listening to the 246 songs on their playlist.</TP><TP>Around the time people stopped wearing masks, they asked their parents to come to Copenhagen. In the King’s Garden, a local wedding official named Peter asked Tom if he wanted to marry Annelot. Tom made sure to look into Annelot’s eyes and squeeze her hand as he calmly said to Peter that yes, he would like that very much. Annelot interrupted Peter when he was halfway through asking her the same question. Yes! That was exactly what she wanted.</TP><TP>Love multiplies when it is shared with others, and so they started planning a party for all of their favorite people. A celebration of the weekend four years earlier, when Tom stepped on a flight that sparked a thousand playlists.</TP>"

Public transport runs throughout the night. Alternatively, Hallesches Haus can also be reached by foot, bike or taxi. </TP><TP>The dress code for the day is “upstage the bride”. Annelot will not be wearing a white wedding dress, but please, wear yours. Dramatic, extravagant, colorful, glittering or otherwise loud outfits are equally appreciated.</TP><TP>Guests are welcome at the venue from 16:00 onwards. We fear that the day will be extremely boring for most humans under eighteen (but exhilarating for everyone else).</TP><TP>The ceremony will start around 16:30 and will be led by our dear friend Chandrika Narayanan-Mohan. The proceedings will take approximately one hour.</TP><TP>The rite will be followed by a reception and sit-down family-style dinner with ample time for speeches. If you wish to give a speech, please contact our masters of ceremony Britt Boeddha and Mei Lee at mc@tommelot.com. This is a bilingual wedding, so you can speak your native language. We will do our best to provide translations.</TP><TP>At around 22:00, the couple hopes to be doing some awkward slow dancing in front of you to start off the wedding disco. The people at Hallesches Haus have begged us to leave by 03:00, but feel free to go clubbing in one of Berlin’s many all-weekender club options if you don’t want to go to bed yet. Let us know if you got into Berghain.</TP>"
